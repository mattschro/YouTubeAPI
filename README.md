# YouTubeAPI
 
This project scrapes data from the MrBeast Gaming channel using the YouTube API. The raw data is then cleaned, some new variables are made, and the code is setup to determine the daily views, comments, and likes for each video on the channel. Additionally, a Python for Shiny dashboard was made, where metrics about the channel (sich as views per day, comments, duration in minutes, days since published, etc.) can be compared.

A video going over the Shiny for Python dashboard can be found here: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70669547/212502659-2ac6ae8f-3a15-4e53-8219-e4102e373017.mov
