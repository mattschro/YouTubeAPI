# YouTubeAPI
 
This project scrapes data from the MrBeast main channel and MrBeast Gaming channel using the YouTube API. The raw data is then cleaned, some new variables are made, and the code is setup to determine the daily views, comments, and likes for each video on both channels. 

Additionally, a Python for Shiny dashboard was made for the MrBeast Gaming channel, where metrics about the channel (sich as views per day, comments, duration in minutes, days since published, etc.) can be compared.

A prediction of the number of the views on each video on the main MrBeast channel is in the works on the file 'ViewsPrediction.ipynb'
